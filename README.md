# learning-session-timer
A Chrome Extension, a timer to help you maintain intense focus and effort toward learning.

## Motivation
Solid research shows that 90 minutes is about the longest period we can expect to maintain intense focus and effort 
toward learning. Shorter bouts are fine but after ~90 minutes, take a break. Also, space intense learning bouts 2-3 
(or more) hours apart. Most people canâ€™t do more than 270 minutes of intense learning bouts per day.
